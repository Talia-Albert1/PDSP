Gather Rat Brains from -80 (approximately 4 to 5)

Cut into small pieces using (scissor things)

Manual
    Add small chunks to glass homogenizer and add approximately 2 mL Lysis Buffer
    Completely homogenize
    Add to 50mL centrifuge tube
    Rinse glass homogenizer with lysis buffer when finished
    Fill centrifuge tube to approximately 50mL with Lysis buffer
    Split into 4 50mL tubes, fill to approximately 40mL
    

Tissue Terror
    Split brains into 4 50mL centrifuge tubes and fill to ~35mL w/ Lysis Buffer
    Using tissue tearer upstairs
        Clean with water first
        Do 4x 15s cycles of tearing (low enough that bubbles aren't being produced)
        Clean with water


Use the upstairs centrifuge, centrifuge at 4C, 1000 rcf, 15 min
    Collect supernatant into special centrifuge tubes??? 
    Discard pellet into biohazard bin
    Fill Special tubes w/ ~35 mL Lysis buffer (~109.00 g will prevent overfilling in most cases)

    **It is important not to overfill the tubes, a total volume of around 40mL should be sufficient**
    **Overfilling the tube will prevent the vacuum from being able to work sufficiently, causing errors**
Repeat 2 times:
    Perfectly balance special centrifuge tubes, centrifuge @ 4C, 200000 rcf, 45 min
        Discard supernatant (we want pellet)
        Resuspend Pellet in 35 mL Lysis Buffer
