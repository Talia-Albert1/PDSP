# Saturation Binding Assay
## Protein Concentration
1. Resuspend pellet in 12 mL Lysis Buffer (10mM Tris + 5% Sucrose, pH 7.4):
    - Use 1 mL Lysis Buffer to break up pellet
    - Fill to ~12 mL
    - Pool pellets into one tube (if multiple pellets)
2. Perform Bradford Protein Concentration Assay:
    - Sample Preparation:
        - 10 uL Pellet Suspension + 790 uL dH20 + 200 uL Bradford Reagent
    - Blank Preparation:
        - 10 uL Lysis Buffer + 790 uL dH20 + 200 uL Bradford Reagent
    - Incubate @ RT 10 min
    - Measure absorbance @ 595 nm
    - Calculate protein concentration:
        - Protein Concentration (ug/uL) = (OD@595 nm - 0.094) / (0.503)

## Hot Ligand Addition
3. Prepare ~11 mL BB (Binding Buffer) w/BSA (~22 uL)
4. In an empty 96-well shallow plate:
    1. Add 330 uL BB to well H and 165 uL BB to well A-G
    2. Add calculated 3H-Ligand to Well H:
        - Need starting concentration (nM) and 3H-Ligand Specific Activity (Ci/mmol)
