Gather Rat Brains from -80 (approximately 4 to 5)

Cut into small pieces using (scissor things)

Manual
    Add small chunks to glass homogenizer and add approximately 2 mL Lysis Buffer
    Completely homogenize
    Add to 50mL centrifuge tube
    Rinse glass homogenizer with lysis buffer when finished

Tissue Terror
    Split brains into 4 50mL centrifuge tubes and fill to ~35mL w/ Lysis Buffer
    Using tissue tearer upstairs
        Clean with water first
        Do 4x 15s cycles of tearing ~10 (low enough that bubbles aren't being produced)
        Clean with water

Fill centrifuge tube to approximately 50mL with Lysis buffer
    Split into 4 50mL tubes, fill to approximately 40mL

Use the upstairs centrifuge, centrifuge at 4C, 1000 rcf, 15 min
    Collect supernatant into special centrifuge tubes??? 
    Discard pellet into biohazard bin
    Fill Special tubes w/ ~35 mL Lysis buffer

Repeat 3 times (first time is something, 2nd and 3rd are considered washes):
    Perfectly balance special centrifuge tubes, centrifuge @ 4C, 200000 rcf, 45 min
        Discard supernatant (we want pellet)
        Resuspend Pellet in Lysis Buffer
